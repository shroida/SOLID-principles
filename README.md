# SOLID Principles

This project demonstrates the **SOLID principles** of object-oriented programming with Dart. The SOLID principles are a set of design guidelines to make software more maintainable, scalable, and easier to understand.

## SOLID Principles Overview

1. **S** - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
   A class should have only one reason to change.  
   **Example**: Separation of business logic and data storage.

2. **O** - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**  
   Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.  
   **Example**: Using inheritance or interfaces to add new functionality without modifying existing code.

3. **L** - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
   Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.  
   **Example**: Derived classes should not break the behavior of the base class.

4. **I** - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
   A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.  
   **Example**: Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

5. **D** - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
   High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.  
   **Example**: Use dependency injection to decouple modules.
